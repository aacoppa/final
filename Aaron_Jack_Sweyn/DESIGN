What is it?
===========

We are creating a multiplayer command line game to be implemented either turn base or real time (We haven't decided).

The idea is that you are a cursor and that you are racing to the right of the screen but have to avoid things, like
the game jetpack joy ride mixed with bike race (Two iPhone apps).

Roles

-ASCII Graphic artist

Timeline
