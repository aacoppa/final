	This program implements a simple quiz game to be played on one computer, using a networking format for communication. Two separate users have their scores tabulated separately, and have separate terminals. The third terminal is running the server. There are no special files required to run the quiz game.

	Through this project I learned a lot about compsci. Often I find myself trying to take the problem head on, and I dont think of it the way I need to, in parts. During my first attempt at doing this project, I tried to do everything at once, and I ended up with useless functions and code that didnt achieve anything. Instead by taking the problem one step at a time, and ensuring that it worked at each step, I was able to complete my project.
