DESIGN DOCUMENT FOR QUIZ GAME

Team: Henry Dlhopolsky, solo

Problem/Project:
The goal of my project will be to make a working quiz game that will work over a
network. The quiz game itself will start out as a simple multiple choice quiz based upon
common nerd-culture knowledge. But this may evolve if the project is completed before due.

User Interface:
The user interface will be simple. The user will recieve in their terminal a message of
a multiple choice question, and will proceed to enter a, b, c or d. Both players Must respond, otherwise the game will not continue. Scores will be tabulated at the end of the game.
Time planning:
Initally, I will create a version of the quiz game using named pipes, and two files,
a client and a server. That will be done by friday, 1/17/2014. Next, I will be upgrading it to
use a network. Ideally that will be done by monday, 1/20/2014.
