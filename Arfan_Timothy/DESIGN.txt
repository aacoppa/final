5 card draw poker
=========
In this version of 5 card draw poker, there are 4 players. All players can be computers that play against one another. To enable this change "#define ONLYCPU 0" to be "#define ONLYCPU 1" in the player.h file. The game works by initializing all structures, building the deck, players, game, shuffling the deck, and then dealing out cards to players.

Once cards are dealt initially they can be seen by the human player. After cards are dealt and displayed on the screen each user HAS to put 5 chips (out of their initial 100) into the pot. If a user cannot put in 5 chips they automatically lose and their remaining chips will go into the pot.
