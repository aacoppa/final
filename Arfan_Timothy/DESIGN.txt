===========================


BlackJack
=========

There will be one computer acting as the "house" by being the server.
Clients will connect to the server and the server will decide when to start the game.
Then you play the game and players can join a game in progress but will not fully connect until a turn is done.
Player will play in the terminal with a text-based interface.


Class Topics Used
=================

Semaphores:
	Because of the nature of blackjack, it will not matter what order players make their moves.
	Thus semaphores will be able to just keep track of when a turn is over.

Networking:
	Connect players and the house.

Processes:
	Forking for each turn.

Structs:
	An array of structs to be the deck(s).


Timeline
========
Create clients, server, and network by the start of next week. 
Figure out the algorithms needed for the rules of blackjack and have the program working by the end of next week. 
Debug and fix over that weekend.
