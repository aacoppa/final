TributeStance

We wrote a functional, stack-based language based on the esoteric programming language FALSE.
As is demonstrated by our extensive and unrelated README, we initially intended to create a
distributed esoteric programming language, but due to the untimely unconsciousness of the
group member who wrote 90% of the necessary network code, that project had to be revised. We
reevaluated what we like about it and refined that into a superior phoenix, rising from the
disarray and the datarray of TributeStance. The new version is more esoteric than ever and
has a utility bound to every ASCII character.
The stack-basedness allows a lack for a lack of any variables whatsoever, while still being
fully Turing-complete. Also it looks really hackerish =D
