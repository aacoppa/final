TODO:

Done:
-> Storing large values from stdin to memory (bitwise)
   - translate input from stdin to binary string
   - storing binary string as a memory chunk of unsigned ints
     (32 bit / 4 byte chunks) which is, essentially, storing the value
     bitwise in base 2^32-1
-> Adding stored values

Currently working on:
-> Decode large values and feed to stdout to allow for view and
   checking (debugging)

Needs to Be Done (priority order):

-> Break Down Current Methods into smaller chunks, smaller methods
   Will improve workflow.

-> Subtracting stored values
-> Multiplying stored values
-> Dividing stored values
-> Exponentiating stored value

Extension:
-> RSA program
