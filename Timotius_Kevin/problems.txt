Problems with this project:

 - When we began we had assumend that there would be a way to
   synchronize the subservers created by fork() in order to make 
   them wait for ne another and perhaps interact with each other.
   However, because of the nature of forks being merely copies of 
   parent that has no other connection to the other children besides
   the fact that they are from the same parent. 

 - At the end we were unable to use fork to do the project because of it

 - we decided to try using thread instead, and at first threads are able 
   to share memory and thus somewhat intearct with other threads. However,
   threads continue to fail to wait for one another so that they would have	
   same prompts throughout the game(Test Tserver/Tclient to see this behavior).

 - Overall, we missed the important fact that C is by nature a blocking 
   language that tries to executre one thing first before others. In order
   to do the project, we would need to implement something to simulate 
   concurrent processing, something that we were unable to do. 

 - We gave it our best.
