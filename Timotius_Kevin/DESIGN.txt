Project Description: 
     We are recreating the multiplayer card game "Cards against Humanity"
     which is similar to the classic game Apples to Apples but for a more 
     adult demographic. 

     Game elements:
              - There will be two types of cards, 
            "Prompt" cards and "Answer" cards
         - Prompt cards will contain prompts which can include things 
            such as questions, fill in the blank, etc.
         - 10 Answer cards will be given to each players.
         - There will be a "Card Czar" randomly chosen from the players
            ans he/she not be playing for the round but will instead determine
            who wins the round. 
         - The rounds will be 30 (testing?) seconds each

      Game Flow:
         1. At the beginning of the round the Card Czar is chosen and the 
            prompt card is shown to all the players. 
         2. Each players will choose 1 (or 2 depending on the prompt)
            anwer card from their hands. 
         3. Each player will then receive another answer card. 
         4. After all players answer, the answers are revealed to all players. 
            All answer cards are anonymous. 
         5. The Card Czar then chooses the best response out of the available 
            choices
         6. The winner of the round will receive one point. 
         
      How to win:
               First person to 10 points win

User interface:
     Everyone:
        - When connecting to the game, everyone is asked to enter their name
        - Each round everyone is able to see the prompt on the command line
          and the card Czar's name will be announced.
        - Each round will last 30 seconds (Testing?) and will be indicated 
          by an internal timer. The timer will print the time every 10 seconds.
        - After every player enters their answer(s), the prompt and all 
          submitted answer will be shown. 
        - After card Czar chooses who wins, there will be s score board like 
                                 Points
          | Player 1        2       |   note: "Player x" will be replaced 
          | Player 2        3       |   by name
          | Player 3        7       |
          | Player 4        4 + 1   | <--- indicates winner of round
          
     Players:
        - Players are able to see their 10 answer cards which will have 
          numbers corresponding from 1-10 
        - Players enter a number that will correspond to their card 
          (two numbers seperated by a space if promopt needs 2 answers)
        - After entering a number, players are draw a new card in the space
          of the card(s) they used. 
        - Player are unable to do anything while they wait for the timer 
          to run out or until everyone plays a card(s).

     Card Czar: 
        - The card Czar will only be able to see the prompt card
          as well as the timer counting down. Note: Even though they 
          cannot see their answer cards, they will retain the same ones 
          in the next round. 
        - They will choose a winner by entering a number 1-4 that correponds 
          with the card

Technical Design 

     Topics incorporated in project:
     
      Networking
         - We will use a TCP server for its greater reliability 
               - We will incorporate a forking server that will server as connections
                 to each of our players.

      String Manipulation
         - Since the game heavily relies on words and phrases transferring
           between server and client, there is a variety of string stuff.

      Accessing/manipulation of Files
         - The cards for the game are included as text files that we use as 
           a resourcce to derive the cards everytime the server starts. 
         - open/close a file & reading files are done in the server

         *Note: These are only the main topics. There are of course many 
                 general things that covered that were used but these stood out
                as the most noticable.

     Responsibility(WHO DOES WHAT?)
              - We did not establish any general guidelines as to whom would do 
           what more.
