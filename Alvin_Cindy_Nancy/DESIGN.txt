Project Description:
     We will be creating a multiplayer game in which users will race against each other (and possibly computers too) to solve mazes.
     Each round, the server will generate a random maze and send it to the clients. Each client will try to complete the maze in the shortest amount of time possible and earn more points the faster he/she solves the maze. After a certain number of rounds, whoever has the most points will win the game.

User Interface:
     Each client will see the maze that they are solving, the elapsed time, their current ranking, and the points they have earned so far.

     ####################
     #			#   Timer: xxx
     #	/*randomly	#   
     #	  generated	#   Current Place: xx
     #	  maze*/	#   Points: xxx
     #			#
     ####################

     The client will attempt to solve the maze by using their arrow keys (or WASD). After every round, the clients will be shown the rankings list.

     Rank     Name 	  Points
     1	      Player 1     10000
     2	      Player 3      9950
     3	      Player 2      3000

Topics:
    Networking:
	Clients will have to connect to a server to play this game.
    Forking:
	Each time a client connects, a subprocess will be forked off.
    Shared Memory/Semaphores:
    	The rankings list will be memory shared among the subprocesses. After every round, the clients will update their points in the rankings list. A semaphore will be used to ensure only one client will be updating the list at the time so memory is not accidentally overwritten due to sorting.
